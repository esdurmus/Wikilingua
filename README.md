## Description ##

The dataset includes ~770k article and summary pairs in 18 languages from WikiHow. We extracted gold-standard article-summary alignments across languages by aligning the images that are used to describe each how-to step in an article.

The table below shows number of article-summary pairs with a parallel article-summary pair in English.
